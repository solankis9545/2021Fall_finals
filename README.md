Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Indian Premier League.

Background: Indian Premier League also known as IPL is a professional cricket tournament hosted in India where players from multiple international teams participate. There are 8 teams competing over 200 players participating each year and around 60 matches played. As IPL is a cash-rich tournament, multiple factors need to be considered while analyzing players’ performance.

Potential Hypothesis:

1. Event of winning the toss is positively correlated with the event of a team winning the game.

2. Fast bowlers are more effective than spinners during death overs. (Death over – Last 4 overs of the innings)

3. Players aged 35 or more have a lesser impact on the game as compared to younger players.

4. If the top 3 players score more than 60 runs in powerplay (powerplay means the first 6 overs) or bowlers take 3 or more wickets inside the powerplay then the team has a 75% chance of winning the game.

5. Teams with orange or purple cap holder has a higher chance of winning the tournament. (Orange cap – player with highest runs in the tournament, purple cap – player with highest wickets in the tournament)

6. Players that sell for a higher price in the auction do not perform well in the tournament.

We are considering IPL datasets from the year 2008 to 2017.
